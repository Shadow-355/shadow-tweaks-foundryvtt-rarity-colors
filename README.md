# Rarity Colors

### Works with [Tidy5e Sheets](https://github.com/kgar/foundry-vtt-tidy-5e-sheets)! 


**Note: This is module is inspired from the  wonderful work done by [kandashi](https://github.com/kandashi) with the module [Rarity Color](https://github.com/kandashi/rarity-colors) and [p4535992](https://github.com/p4535992/) with the module [FoundryVTT Rarity Colors](https://github.com/p4535992/foundryvtt-rarity-colors)

Give your Inventory and Sidebar a splash of color. Re-colors Actor Inventory Items and the Items Sidebar names with colors based on item rarity and type.

### NOTE: Is been tested only on Dnd5e, but it should work with all the system with the property `system.rarity` as string, a API support is been recently added for help the integration with other system
